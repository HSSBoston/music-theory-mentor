## Project Summary

The Music Theory Mentor (MT Mentor) is a web application that automatically generates practice problems with solutions for students studying music theory and preparing for the AP Music Theory exam. 

Although numerous resources exist for general music theory study, materials specifically designed for AP Music Theory are severely limited. Unlike other AP subjects such as Physics, Chemistry, and Economics, there is no dedicated AP Music Theory textbook, and only a few books provide AP-specific practice problems. As a result, students lack sufficient opportunities for systematic practice.  

MT Mentor addresses this issue by producing an unlimited set of practice problems for core AP Music Theory topics, including key signature, parallel and relative keys, inversion types, sevenths, and sight singing. It is designed to support repetition-based and hands-on practice, which is essential for mastering theoretical concepts.
